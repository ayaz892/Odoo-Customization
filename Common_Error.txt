OWL ERROR After Restoring DB on Local
_________________________________________
Sometime after restore db to localhost: It showing different OWL related error while opening or updating modules.
Solution: First go to odoo Apps and Search Base Module and Update it. After updating base module again update the module in which you are getting error it will now update correctly.


When migrate custom modules from old version to latest version .we get some common error like in latest odoo version tree tag is replace with list so instead of change them manually use this command:

./odoo-bin upgrade_code --addons-path=custom-directory/custom_directory/custom_module_name --from 17.0

 _____________________________________________

Sometime many instances of odoo is running and causing error so here is the command to kill them:
open terminal and run these two commands
1) ps aux | grep odoo
2) sudo kill -9 68636 (for example PID:68636 is running so this command will kill it)
after running above commands restart odoo.

How to uninstall any module using command line
open venv in your terminal then run this command:

1) ./odoo-bin shell -c odoo.conf -d db_name   (replace with your db_name)

after you will see console like this >>>>>>>>> here put this command
2) self.env['ir.module.module'].search([('name', '=', 'your_module_name')]).button_immediate_uninstall()            (replace with your_module_name to be uninstalled)
after it complete process just type exit() and restart odoo.
